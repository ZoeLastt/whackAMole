# Developer Tech Test

For this tech test i want you to make a simple whack a mole game.

This should help you show what you know about pixi.js

You can have a number of moles which randomly pop up. 

When you successfully touch a mole, you earn a point

Keep score and have a time limit.

At the end of the game, show the final result and have a restart button.

We would like to see examples of classes, async/await if possible.
